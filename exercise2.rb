# Question 1

puts "0.20 * 50"

# 2. Question 2

puts "This is a string " + 5.to_string

#  Question 3

puts "The results are #{45628 * 7839}"

# Question 4

# This equation will become true || true
# The right side is true because the statements inside are true && true
# The left side is true because it will come out to be !false, since 10 is not equal to 11
# Therefore !false = true, making both sides of || true
# Both sides are true which make the equation true

(10 < 20 && 30 < 20) || !(10 == 11)
